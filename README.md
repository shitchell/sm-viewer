# sm-viewer

A simple page to view the webcam atop Stone Mountain. The webcam updates about every 3 minutes; this page updates every minute to make sure it gets the most recent picture without adding too much load.

### TODO

- [ ] Add transition between updates
- [ ] Add timeline box at bottom to see previous images
- [ ] Add option to use cover or fill (black bars or completely fill the screen)
- [ ] Check last modified time to only update image when the image has changed
